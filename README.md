# Bayesian-optimization-with-GPs-for-Aspen
Collaborated effectively with a partner in a semester long project
Developed a high fidelity Aspen model of the Imperial CCS pilot plant
Utilised python to develop a cutting edge Gaussian process based real time optimisation algorithm
Identified the optimal setpoints for the plant using the RTO algorithm whilst remaining within a safe 
operating envelope
Reduced the Reboiler duty by 6.25% whilst keeping the efficiency of the carbon capture high
