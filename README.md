# Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes for Aspen

This repository contains the implementation of a Bayesian optimization algorithm with Gaussian Processes (GPs) to optimize the performance of an Aspen simulator.

The Aspen simulator is a computational tool that allows the simulation of chemical processes. The goal of this project is to optimize the performance of the Aspen simulator by finding the optimal values of some input parameters that lead to the best performance of the process.

The Bayesian optimization algorithm implemented in this project is based on GPs, which are used to model the objective function and provide an estimate of the best input parameters to be tested in the next iteration.
